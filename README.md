# Typescript-template
General Typescript project starter 🤸‍♀️

*Typescript is beautiful except, when it comes to downloading it and configuring it*

*-salah*

It's simple to use ✨
- clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/0ss/Typescript-template.git`
- install dependencies `npm i`
- run `npm run dev` to make sure it works


> **💡:**   You can always edit `tsconfig.json` to configure typescript as you want.


Aaaand you're good to go !🧡
